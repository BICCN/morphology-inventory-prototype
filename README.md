# BICCN Morphology Inventory Prototype

**Goal**: To create a community resource as an integral part of the BICCN Morphology Working group joint analysis effort containing
CCF-mapped morphologies with annotation of cell body locations and projection targets.
The inventory integrates imaging, reconstruction and registration data from multiple teams in a standardized format and organization
along with essential metadata and provenance.

**The inventory will include**
* Organism/brain essential metadata
* Link to primary image data
* Downsampled version of primary image data in a standardized 3D image data format
* Link to imaging protocol and methods
* Cell reconstruction in primary data coordinates in a standardized SWC format
* Link to reconstruction protocol and methods
* Resampled primary image data mapped to the CCF at 10 micron resolution in a standardized 3D image data format
* Link to CCF registration protocol and methods
* Resampled cell reconstruction in CCF coordinates in a standardized SWC format
* CCF based computed and visualization
  * Computed after submission and based on specific version of CCF atlas annotation
  * [See prototype thumbnails for the U19Zeng project](u19zeng_demo/index.html)
